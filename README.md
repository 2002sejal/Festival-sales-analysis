# Diwali Sales Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze sales data from a retail company during the Diwali festive season. Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is one of the most significant festivals in India and is often associated with increased consumer spending and shopping.

## Overview

The dataset used in this analysis contains information about sales transactions, including customer demographics, product categories, purchase amounts, and timestamps. The primary objective is to gain insights into consumer behavior, popular product categories, sales trends, and performance during the Diwali period.

## Data Sources

- The sales data was sourced from the retail company's internal database or CRM system.
- Additional data sources may include external market research reports, surveys, or government statistics on consumer spending and retail trends during Diwali.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
   - Standardize data formats and units for consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze sales trends over time, including daily, weekly, and monthly patterns.
   - Identify popular product categories and customer segments based on sales volume and revenue.
   - Explore geographical distribution of sales and regional variations.

3. **Consumer Behavior Analysis:**
   - Analyze customer demographics (age, gender, location) and their purchasing preferences.
   - Investigate customer loyalty, repeat purchases, and churn rates.
   - Identify factors influencing purchase decisions during the Diwali festive season.

4. **Product Performance Analysis:**
   - Evaluate sales performance for different product categories.
   - Identify best-selling products, high-margin items, and slow-moving inventory.
   - Analyze pricing strategies and discounts offered during Diwali sales promotions.

5. **Sales Forecasting and Predictive Modeling (Optional):**
   - Develop predictive models to forecast sales volume, revenue, and demand for Diwali sales events.
   - Incorporate external factors such as economic indicators, marketing campaigns, and competitor analysis.
